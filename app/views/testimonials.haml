        The best BBQ I've ever had, period. Its that simple! I've tried Rio's ribs and many other and Brandon Whitlow's food outshines the competition by leaps and bounds! Can't wait for the food haven to open! Mad Love!

        Brandon makes the meanest brisket and the best mac 'n cheese I've ever had. His food helped make my latest birthday celebration one of the best. Thanks B!
